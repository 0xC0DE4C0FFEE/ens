# ENS

The Ethereum Name Service is Ethereum's solution to the problem of naming in distributed systems. ENS eliminates the need to copy - and worse, type - long hexadecimal addresses. With ENS, you'll be able to send money to your friend at 'aardvark.eth' instead of 0x4cbe58c504805c78eb3043b02309dedb7e4d6d68, interact with your favorite contract at 'mycontract.eth', or visit a Swarm-hosted site at 'swarmsite.eth'. ENS aims to entirely remove the need to deal with cryptographic addresses in day-to-day use of Ethereum altogether.

ENS can also be used to store additional information, making interacting with contracts easier for users and DApp authors, and providing reverse lookups, enabling applications to show your ENS name and other information given just your account address.

ENS domains exist under the ".eth" top level domain, and anyone can register one for themselves by participating in an auction process, with prices for uncontested domains being only 0.01 ether.
